Using data from the CARES database, the system profiles residents based on multiple criteria and assigns them appropriate roles: Lead Surgeon, Assisted Operator, Assistant, or Observer.

The goal is to achieve a balance between patient safety and resident training by using a LightGBM-based model to fairly assign both experienced and less-experienced residents to surgical procedures.
